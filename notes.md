# 2015 day 7

Different ideas for solving this problem:

 - mine: classic parsing & execution of the language by recursively compute dependency the tree, starting from the goal 
 - use regex to reformat and sort the code (?!), then run eval
 - use regex to write a large recursive solver: https://gist.github.com/mgiuffrida/f275912b9bd92a3f403e
 - use Z3 to solve the tree https://mobeigi.com/blog/capture-the-flag/advent-of-code/advent-of-code-day-7/

# day 9 and 13

Basically the same problem (a short travelling salesman problem).
It was fun to use `itertools.permutations`, which does not come up very ofter.

# 2015 day 10
There was an interesting construct, where you have to implement a sequence
of the form `n = f(n)`, then call it many times:

```python
def look_and_say(input, nb_iterations=40):
    n = input
    for _ in range(nb_iterations):
        n = next_it(n)
    return len(n)
```

`next_it` implements the [Look-and-say sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence).

It can be done with `itertools` too:
```python
from itertools import accumulate
def look_and_say(input, nb_iterations=40):
    l = lambda a, b: next_it(a)
    iterations = accumulate(range(nb_iterations), l, initial=input)
    return len(list(iterations)[-1])
```
Since our function `next_it` only takes one parameter, we have to introduce
a lambda with 2 parameters and not use the second one.

The problem is that `accumulate` return an iterator over all the values,
while we are  only interested in the last one.

A better solution is to use `functools.reduce`: 

```python
from functools import reduce
def look_and_say(input, nb_iterations=40):
    # we need to introduce a lambda
    l = lambda a, b: next_it(a)
    final_value = reduce(l, range(nb_iterations), input)
    return len(final_value)
```

# day 11

The `inc_password` that generates the next password was fun to write:
```python
def next_char(c): return chr(ord(c)+1)
def inc_password(p):
    pos = len(p)-1
    p2 = list(p)
    carry = 1
    while carry == 1:
        if p2[pos] != 'z':
            p2[pos] = next_char(p2[pos])
            carry = 0
        else:
            p2[pos] = 'a'
            pos -= 1
            carry = 1
            if pos < 0:
                raise ValueError("Everything has been exhausted ! Overflow")

    return "".join(p2)
```

# day 12

Finding all the integers in a json object with a regex was so fast! So happy with this hack

```python
def part1(input):
    """Finding all the integers is solved with a regex"""
    ints = map(int, re.findall(r"(-?\d+)", input))
    return sum(ints)
```

# day 15

my initial attempt with brute force was very slow. We can use partitions:

## Day 4

Quite happy with my (non-necessary) grid design that Iâ€™ve used in other problems already.
Grid display (modified from `display` on http://norvig.com/sudoku.html) is quite versatile
